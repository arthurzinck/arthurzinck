  I help small and medium businesses modernize their infrastructure so they can focus on innovation instead of worrying about stability and resilience.

  **Infrastructure Modernization** — Kubernetes migrations (on-premise, AWS, OVH, Scaleway), CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native transformations that reduce complexity and operational burden.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  **Cost Optimization** — Identifying savings opportunities in cloud spend through architectural changes, spot/flex instances, and strategic on-premise solutions.
